<h1>Lean Chemical Theories</h1>

<p>This web page is a collection of lean documentation, with a semi-interactive viewer, for the paper 
<b>Formalizing Chemical Theory using the Lean Theorem Prover</b> 
by <a target="_blank" href ="https://atomslab.github.io/"> ATOMS Lab </a> 
at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.</p>


<h2>GitHub repository</h2>
<p>We have a <a target ="_blank" href = "https://github.com/ATOMSLab/LeanChemicalTheories/tree/Static-Branch-from-8/28/2022">
static branch </a> of our repository where all the proofs are in state as it was on 2022/08/28, to align with the code referenced in the paper. 
It compiles with Lean version 3.45.0 and mathlib commit <a target="_blank"  
href= "https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/c59720b460605812986068342d81f50d3740fd8e"> 
`c59720b460605812986068342d81f50d3740fd8e` </a></p>

<p>The codes will likely evolve to keep up with updates to Lean and mathlib versions. 
The most up-to-date version can be found in the main branch which is also deployed 
in this website.</p>


<p>On the left menu, the "General" section provide links with extra
information about mathlib and Lean. The "Library" section contains 
dropdown subsections according to mathlib's tree structure.</p>

<p>
The instructions to install Lean, mathlib, and supporting tools are on the official 
<a target="_blank" href ="https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html"> Lean website</a>.
